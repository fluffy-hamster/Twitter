* Im on Python 3.7, you'll need at least 3.5 because of I use type hints.
* For security reasons I haven't uploaded "auth.py" to a public repo. So if you want to run the code you will need to create this file (I've provided a template to follow).
* Didn't add unit tests. Not because I cant write them but because I couldn't be bothered to mess arround with mocking/dependancy injection. Moreover, I found that there were few opportunities to write 'pure' functions.
* Due to time, glossed over a bunch of details, (e.g, error handling, folder stuctures, unit tests, etc).
* Skipped 2nd exercise. Again, due to time.
